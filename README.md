Hello, my name is Asher, this repository is an 
base for an game i am going to make and sell eventually.
And also an study because i am learning unity while worling on this!
You can use the code as you want, just credit me, 
and do not use any art from the game to commercial purposes! (player sprites, etc)

cheers thanks for reading
